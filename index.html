</p><p>I have recently purchased a security certificate for bingster, so I can now use
HTTP/3, which has recently been added to the stable version of NGINX. HTTP/1.1
and HTTP/2 use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). QUIC QUIC (Quick UDP
Internet Connections) is built on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and
is designed to reduce latency, improve connection migration, and enhance
security, particularly for web applications. HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 use TCP
(Transmission Control Protocol), whereas QUIC is built on UDP (User Datagram
Protocol).
</p> 
<p>   UDP is often used for video delivery, but there are other protocols, such as HTTP
Live Streaming (HLS), which utilises adaptive streaming, or Real-Time Transport
Protocol (RTP). With video content and audio messages, losing packets of data is not
a problem as we can quickly move on, but there are messages where package
loss is unacceptable. UDP is a faster protocol cos it does not maintain a
connection.
</p> 
<p>   While UDP does have these problems, they can be overcome using programming
the code would need to address issues such as:
</p> 
<p>

</p> 
<p>   In an architecture that uses multiple servers to communicate using other
protocols, the TCP can help the network become more resilient, as there can often
be problems with the network and ports. This recently happened to me
when my server’s memory became exhausted, only connecting via serial port.
Therefore, developing a class that encapsulates messaging protocols using the
strategy pattern should be considered. Indeed, Chaos Engineering is used by
Netflix to ensure it is resilient, so switching off different services could also be
implemented.
</p> 
<p>   But it’s not all about speed, but it helps to give users a great user experience.
Well, if it was, I wouldn’t be using Laravel... - It has Google’s Lighthouse integrated,
which enables Testing for accessible issues that can be difficult for designers to
identify. Indeed, several other tools provide heuristic and accessible evaluations to the
I have started implementing these classes.

</p><p>Not just talking about my architecture, I have had two biopsies on my nose, much
like Hugh Jackman, and I have no bags under my eyes now. It was probably caused
by wearing cheap glasses or crashing my electric bike.
</p> 
<p>   Apart from that, I have also spent much time applying for jobs, and I
had an interview for a position where they asked for a presentation on the
company. I didn’t get the job as I didn’t have experience in call handling.
Anyway, it was nice to get off doing thirty-five hours of job searching and
spending five days researching a company. The best people for the job are
often rejected, such as Sofja Kowalewskaja, the first woman to get a PhD in
mathematics.

<p id='-march-oops-oops-blog-neglect'><a id='Q1-1-7'></a>
</p><p>I have not fulfilled my New Year’s resolution of making blog posts; I have not found
the time for many reasons. Since my last post, I have been identifying how best to
design and put websites into production. An obvious solution is Kubernetes
implemented on a cloud host such as Google or Microsoft Azure, but your website
will go down if you run out of credit. There are many other reasons for
using a multi-cloud strategy apart from migrating risks; some providers have
specific functionality, such as IBM having Watson and Amazon having a more
straightforward user interface.
</p> 
<p>   Indeed, even the best service providers have downtime, which I recently
discovered as I am currently pointing my domain at my GitHub Page. I have also
been using Codespaces. However, this may point to a problem with the scalability
and availability of Kubernetes when deploying clusters that use code loaded from
systems such as GitHub and Docker. Nevertheless, an outage for a version control
system is costly to an organisation, reducing the team’s productivity. As a lone
developer, I found it frustrating to use Github to switch between using a
laptop and a computer; indeed, Github also has a mobile app. GitLab is
popular but only compatible with GitHub if you have a GitLab premium
account.
</p> 
<p>   The programming language used in Kubernetes affects the speed of the
application. Kubernetes is written in Go; I have been learning Go, but Rust is a
faster programming language... These programming languages are functional and are
highly complex. Most of my previous work has used languages such as PHP, for
which I have been receiving many emails asking about my interest in roles. Therefore,
I favour using Roadrunner, a PHP server written in Go. This benefits by enabling the
development of websites using the simple syntax of PHP while having the ability to
make optimisations using Go.

</p><p>I have received an email on Indeed asking me to apply for a job as a React developer,
and I am applying for it as the job is for a company that delivers a workflow solution
for companies in the renewable sector. This aligns with my goals; however, the
position requires 4 years of React experience, but I haven’t used it in 2 years as it
                                                                  

                                                                  
was not used in my dissertation year, and I have not used it while studying MSc
Applied Data Science.
</p> 
<p>   I encountered React several times during my BSc Web Technologies and Digital
Media degree as it has features that benefit a developer, especially when features are
implemented differently amongst all browsers. I first came across it in my first year;
for an assignment, I created a post-it note website; the library simplified creating
elements. I also used it due to Redux, which enables state management during an
animation assignment.
</p> 
<p>   I would like to find my old code, but I have probably lost the code in one of my
old hard drives or hidden deep in a file system. I find it difficult to look back at old
cos because learning new things often helps you identify flaws in the old code.
Looking back on the assignments produced, there are many errors to rectify.
Unfortunately, this is going to be necessary as I am going to need to find a
job.

</p><p>I have purchased a domain off GoDaddy, but I need government-issued identification,
which they require to verify your account. Unfortunately, I currently only
have a student card, so I will have to wait until the end of the month to get
the ID and wait for it. It may take some time; it is expensive, but I also
need to get other forms of ID, such as a birth certificate, before I can get
that.
</p> 
<p>   I was looking forward to using GoDaddy because they also have virtual servers, so
I could do some programming in languages such as Python and Java; my current
provider only has support for PHP. A domain would help by not needing to
remember IP addresses; it looks more professional. However, there are many other

a limit to the number of repositories you can use as Pages; therefore, I have upgraded

   <h3 class='likesectionHead' id='-february-reflection-on-msc-data-science'><a id='x1-7000'></a>28 February 2023 <br class='newline' />Reflection on Msc Data Science</h3>
<p id='-february-reflection-on-msc-data-science1'><a id='Q1-1-13'></a>
</p><p>I am reflecting on the last year, 2022 when I was studying MSc in Applied Data
Science. I thought I had until 4th January; however, in December, I got told this was
just a glitch in the system and stopped being a student in September. So, the course
started on 4th October 2022. I started later that year after receiving my BSc Degree
certificate late in October. The course started well, although the first payment I
paid to the university for the course didn’t go to my account due to my
name getting misspelt (thanks to COVID masks at the bank). Later, my
banks, Eccount and Uaccount, went into administration and buggered up my
life.
</p> 
<p>   The course was in the school of engineering, and I learnt a lot that I did not
expect: electrical engineering and renewable energy. In the first semester, we studied
Research Methods and Artificial Intelligence for my elective; I did Digital Image and
Signal Processing, a 75 percent exam I was sure I would fail. The others were 50
percent coursework and 50 percent exam. Although I knew I would fail, the
subject was interesting... If I could figure out where the buttons were on the
calculator, I was in for a chance, but I couldn’t find the button; I tried to use my
newfound knowledge that sine is the derivative of cosine. It didn’t work out,
but Research Methods have interested me greatly, and that deadline was
sooner.
</p> 
<p>   In Research Methods. A member of my class and I were teamed with two people
from the MSc Renewable Energy course to evaluate monitored data from two real
photovoltaic systems located at UCLAN against simulated data. For the assignment,
we were assigned roles. The people from renewable energy were to provide a
literature review, the other person from my course was to do the simulation, and I
was to validate the simulated and monitored data. I didn’t assign myself the role but
took on the part. Our tutor assigned roles; this was strange because the assignment
required us to write about using an Agile methodology and having roles ensured that
we used a waterfall methodology. Agile development requires a team to communicate
regularly to create an iteration of the product. Unfortunately, the team
communicated via WhatsApp, which was unfortunate not having a mobile telephone
myself. I thought we were using Microsoft Teams, and everyone was too busy
researching.

<p>   As you can see, I took on validating the monitored data. So, I needed to learn
how to verify and validate simulated data. Unfortunately, I did not have experience
doing this or a Windows computer to create the simulation (I could have used
WINE or a Virtual Machine hired from FFS). So, the task was to validate the
simulation, ensuring input and output were between a range of possible
values.
</p> 
<p>   There are many ways of modelling a system; it can be modelled in terms of its
input and output using equations such as Partial and Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODE). They are used to model phenomena such as heat transfer. Indeed,
photovoltaic systems have similarities with the heat conduction problem as they
convert heat into electrical energy. To solve these equations, numerical techniques
such as root-finding methods such as the Newton, Secant and polynomial root-finding
techniques are often used when there is no analytical solution. Unfortunately,
computer systems are prone to truncation errors due to the finite precision of
numbers and are considered unavoidable errors that occur when a continuous
function is approximated; another is the effect of solar radiation on the computing
system.
</p> 
<p>   I found the use of polynomials interesting, as this was the first time I had
encountered them since school. They were also studied while studying Artificial
Intelligence; using them for prediction in regression analysis, the inputs can be
modified to measure the effect on output. They provide a simple mathematical
model, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to measure improvements
made by adding more or fewer polynomials. Solve PDE and ODEs can also be
converted into them, although this is what we were still researching at the time.
Another interesting thing is that they are used to prove the existence of complex
numbers in the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Solving PDE and ODE can be
converted into equations, too - although I was unaware of this then, and the
recommended reading pointed to an auto-regressive parameter estimation
method.
</p> 
<p>   Bohr’s atom model can identify things such as if an atom is likely to be
conductive, as it identifies how many and the positions of the electrons in the atom.
Neutrons and photons are made of quarks top, bottom, charm, strange, up,
and down, whereas electrons are fundamental particles like quarks. Bohr’s
model considers particles to be physical objects orbiting a centre. However,
Thomas Young demonstrated the wave–particle duality through the double-slit
experiment in 1802, and the theory is demonstrated in many books on quantum
computing; it identifies that electrons do not just act as a particle. Heinrich
Hertz proved the existence of electromagnetic waves by using a spark gap
transmitter.
</p> 
<p>   Photocells only use one photon to push the electron into the valence band
(or shell), which is the outer shell of electrons, and the photon is within
a specific wavelength range. Different materials have different abilities to
transmit electricity. This highlights another method - optical modelling,
which could determine if the material has deformities, as a photovoltaic
cell is made out of different materials, which produce different amounts of
                                                                  

                                                                  
electricity.
</p> 
<p>   Most textbooks create an electrical circuit model; I followed a text recreating it in
Matlab, which produced IV curves. Unfortunately, I needed help with the code and
requested the book’s publisher for its source code, but they only provided that to
lectures. I also contacted one of the book’s authors, but he didn’t have it; the code
was from the other author. But by that time, I found other resources. Matlab
provides several modelling methods, such as Simulink, where components can be
developed in a drag-and-drop interface defining their attributes. I choosen to use the
pure code approach, which enabled a greater understanding of the system’s inner
workings.

<p>   I used Villalva’s photovoltaic model, which uses two cells. These account for the
non-linearity, but this does not occur just in photovoltaic cells in Duffy (2016)
Advanced Engineering highlights the work of Fairweather and Ingham (1941):
Subsidence transients in resistors containing none linear resistor with reference to the
problem of spark quenching explains that a non-linear component is more realistic in
a circuit, having more than a non-linear component has a dramatic effect on the
output. Indeed, more than one cell must be simulated as we compare two
photovoltaic panels containing many cells. Thankfully, IV curves are also one of the
outputs of the PV software. Furthermore, Plank’s law allows the measurement of
energy as discrete values.

<p>   A book provided a model of the sun’s irradiation, and a model of the
system, if inputs are correct, should give the output that would correspond to
that of the real and simulated data. So, the data’s distribution matched
the actual data and the simulated but not the actual values. Indeed, the
weather also affects the solar array, and forecasting the weather is challenging.
Several other things need to be considered: the solar array is connected to
an inverter, and the electrical grid to which it is connected imparts their
characteristics. The simulation software used to recreate the data can utilise 3D
object files to play locations and the shadows of buildings. Partial shadows and
clouds affect the photovoltaic array, which may not have been accounted
for.

<p>   Matlab was used for much of the course; it is an appealing language for engineers
because it has functions to help solve equations. It requires a licence, which prevents
it from being portable, expensive, and difficult to scale in Linux: the user needs to
run an activation script before startup, which occurs regularly. Fortunately, Octane is
open source and uses a similar syntax and features, but it lacks the many plugins
Matlab has, such as the Curve Fitting Tool, which we use in Artificial Intelligence. I
would like to revisit this code, but I am not enrolled on the course at the time of
writing.

<p>   In the module Programming with Data, we used Juypyter Notebooks to program
in Python; however, it also supports Julia and R, and the cells can be annotated with
Markdown and render Latex. During Artificial Intelligence, we used Juypyter
Notebooks, Python and TensorFlow during a class about Deep Learning. I noted the
difficulty I was having with producing equations in Microsoft Word, finding writing
them in Latex a better alternative to the drag-and-drop interface that it
offered. Indeed, in the second coursework of Programming with Data, we
                                                                  

                                                                  
used R, which also supports Latex via R Markdown. The good thing about
being able to use equations in your code is to be able to share code with
people who are not familiar with the programming language and to use
proofs and reasoning; a cool thing I would like to see is a library to compile
equations into computer programs, and I don’t think it is far too from been
developed.
