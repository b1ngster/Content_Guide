   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='introduction'><span class='titlemark'>1   </span> <a id='x1-20001'></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>. In our increasingly inclusive society, creating accessible digital learning materials is
essential to support diverse learners, including those with cognitive impairments.
Approximately 2.16 percent of adults in the UK have a learning disability, and one in
five people is neurodivergent. Moreover, an estimated 15–20 per cent of the
population experiences difficulties with text or language comprehension, with
dyslexia affecting 10 per cent of individuals. Additionally, visual impairments can
indirectly impact language comprehension.
</p> 
<p>   In October 2022, in the UK, 154,871 of PIP claimants had an autistic spectrum
disorder recorded as their main condition, accounting for 4.9 per cent of all PIP;
seventy-five per cent were male. Within the UK and Europe, the Equality
Act 2010 prohibits discrimination and promotes equal opportunities for
individuals with protected characteristics, including disabilities; websites must
make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled people can access their
services.
</p> 
<p>   Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018 have adopted Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AA is adopted by public bodies in the
UK, ensuring content is accessible and inclusive. The EU Web Accessibility Directive
sets public sector websites and mobile applications requirements. In the United
States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to websites of public
entities and places of public accommodation.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='valuing-neurodiversity-'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-30002'></a>Valuing Neurodiversity </h3>
<p>Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences like autism and ADHD result
from normal, natural variations in the human genome. Many neurodivergent people
have higher-than-average skills when it comes to skills in pattern recognition,
memory, or mathematics. When SAP started its Autism at Work program in 2013,
applicants included people with master’s degrees in mathematics, physics and
engineering. Some applicants had dual degrees. Hewit Packards Enterprises
placed more than 30 participants in software-testing roles at Australia’s
Department of Human Services research is 30 per cent more productive,
<span class='cmbx-10'>?</span>
</p> 
<p>   People with reading impairments may face challenges accessing and comprehending
traditional job advertisements that rely heavily on written text. Organizations must
consider advertising job positions on nontraditional platforms accommodating various
communication preferences to ensure inclusivity. Such as Instagram, which uses
images and short captions, can make the information more accessible to candidates
with reading difficulties. Additionally, podcasts or audio-based channels to promote
job openings can reach candidates who prefer or rely on auditory information rather
than written content.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='writing-content-for-a-neurodiverse-audience'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-40003'></a>Writing Content for a Neurodiverse Audience</h3>
<p>Large text blocks are challenging for those with reading difficulties. The Minto
Pyramid Principle used technical writers uses a technique of commencing with major
arguments, then progressively detailing more minor points. Heatmaps reveal most
people prefer reading in an F-pattern; use headings establish a visual hierarchy,
aiding navigation and content anticipation.
</p> 
<p>   Conciseness and well-formatted content are essential for effective communication.
The structure and organization of the text, as well as word choice, significantly
influence reader comprehension. For instance, people with moderate learning
disabilities can still easily understand sentences of 5 to 8 words. While neurotypical
people can recognize word shapes and skip words while reading, individuals with
learning difficulties and visual compression impairments may find it more challenging
and read each letter. Comic Sans, although negatively thought of by the design
community, is helpful for dyslexic people.
</p> 
<p>   Guiding sentences involve placing the most important content at the
beginning of the paragraph, enhancing understanding. Using an active voice
improves clarity and focus for readers because the subject performs the
action. Using simple language without idioms will help them get a better
translation.
</p> 
<p>   Acronyms should be well-defined in a place easily accessible by the user. In
software engineering, acronyms such as SPA can have several meanings, such as single
page application. DDD (domain-driven design) uses a shared vocabulary called a
ubiquitous language it ensures everybody has an understanding including
non-domain experts.
</p> 
<p>   Images and other graphics often support written content and reduce the cognitive
load. However, images depicting data, such as graphs, can overload people. Therefore,
choosing a simpler structure like a pyramid is preferable. Research indicates that
emotional images create a more positive learning experience. It is essential
to use alternative text for images to accommodate individuals with visual
impairments, video content should provide captions and audio descriptions where
possible.
</p> 
<p>
   </p> 

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='user-experience-design'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> <a id='x1-50004'></a>User Experience Design</h3>
<p>UX design encompasses the entire user journey and involves understanding
customers, creating prototypes, and testing. UI design focuses on the visual
presentation and aesthetics of the interface. Interaction design focuses on designing
effective and engaging interactions within the interface to enhance the overall user
experience, where aesthetics and usability work to create a pleasurable user
experience. A consistent layout which does not jump between pages provides an
intuitive experience. Microinteractions enhance the user experience by providing
                                                                  

                                                                  
feedback.
</p> 
<p>   The mobile-first approach can simplify user interfaces by starting with a simple
design which is scaled up. The method uses simple icons that can be easily identified,
and links and buttons use self-contained actions that avoid using ambiguous terms
such as ”next” or ”click here.”; instead, it provides clear information about
its expected outcome. It enhances clarity for all users while addressing the
particular needs of individuals with cognitive impairments or mental health
challenges.
</p> 
<p>   Historical breadcrumbs can help people with memory impairments and
hierarchical providing visual-spatial. People may have both conditions; therefore,
having both forms is more beneficial. Visual-spatial impairments affect orientation
and the user’s ability to understand or imagine maps and models. Which theses
disorientated when navigating between a series of pages that make up a more
extensive website.
</p> 
<p>   Providing customizable options and accessibility features in digital content and
interfaces can help mitigate issues and create a more inclusive user experience.
Allowing the user to choose the font size can improve readability. Enabling the user
to choose between light and dark modes and the number of components on the screen
can help reduce overstimulation.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='heuristic-evaluation'><span class='titlemark'>4.1   </span> <a id='x1-60004.1'></a>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
<p>Heuristic frameworks aim to improve website usability, measuring things such as
learnability, usability, reducing cognitive load and reducing errors. Designers should
be aware they were not built to support neurodivergent people. The most popular
frameworks are Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and
Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design. There are many more to
choose from depending on the context of use such as in a voice interface
where.
</p> 
<p>   ISO 9241-110 is a part of the ISO 9241 series of international standards that
addresses human-system interaction and ergonomics. Specifically, ISO 9241-110 is
titled ”Ergonomics of human-system interaction — Part 110: Interaction principles.”
The standard sets a good foundation for addressing accessibility needs emphasizing
the interface should be adaptable such as the support for screen readers and
keyboard navigation.
</p> 
<p>   User interfaces should be adaptable and flexible for different conditions,
such as adapting to different screen sizes and for screen readers, to ensure
consistency in interface design choices such as naming, formats and procedures
are maintained in similar contexts and are different when applied to other
contexts.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag-'><span class='titlemark'>4.2   </span> <a id='x1-70004.2'></a>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0,(WCAG 2,)</h4>
<p>WCAG 2 and the W3C Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force
(COGA) are initiatives by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to promote web
accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The work of COGA contributes to
the overall goal of making web content more accessible and inclusive for
individuals with cognitive impairments within the broader framework of WCAG
2.
</p> 
<p>   WCAG 2, or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, is a set of internationally
recognized guidelines developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines aim to make web content
accessible to people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, cognitive,
and motor impairments. WCAG 2 provides a comprehensive framework to ensure
that digital content and websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and
robust for all users, regardless of their abilities.
</p> 
<p>   WCAG 2 provides four main principles, each with specific guidelines and success
criteria:
</p> 
<p>   1. **Perceivable:** This principle focuses on making web content perceivable to
all users. It includes procedures for providing text alternatives for non-text content,
offering alternatives for time-based media, ensuring content is adaptable, and
distinguishing visual elements.
</p> 
<p>   2. **Operable:** The principle emphasizes that web content should be easy to
navigate and operate. It includes guidelines related to keyboard accessibility,
providing sufficient time for users to read and interact with content, avoiding content
that could cause seizures or physical discomfort, and facilitating navigation and user
interface components.
</p> 
<p>   3. **Understandable:** The understandable principle aims to ensure that content
is clear and comprehensible. It includes readability, predictability, input assistance,
and error prevention guidelines.
</p> 
<p>   4. **Robust:** The robust principle focuses on ensuring that web content is
compatible and interpretable by various user agents, including assistive technologies.
It includes guidelines for using valid code, compatibility with current and future
technologies, and handling content gracefully when technologies are not
supported.
</p> 
<p>   WCAG 2 guidelines set three conformance levels: A, AA, and AAA. Each
level includes a specific set of success criteria, with Level A representing
the minimum level of accessibility and Levels AA and AAA offering higher
levels of accessibility. Achieving full WCAG 2 conformance, especially at the
AAA level, can be challenging for certain types of content and may not
be possible in all situations. WCAG 2 has become the standard for web
accessibility, and many countries and organizations have adopted it as the basis for
their accessibility regulations and policies. By adhering to WCAG 2, web
developers and content creators can enhance the usability and inclusivity
of their digital products, making the web more accessible for people with
disabilities.

<p>Testing at different levels of the software development cycle is vital to prevent errors
before they reach the production stage. Unit testing focuses on testing small,
individual code units, acceptance testing ensures that the application meets business
requirements, and integration testing verifies the interactions between different
components.
</p> 
<p>   While automated tests are a cornerstone of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and
Deployment) pipelines, human evaluators can catch unintended errors that may
                                                                  

                                                                  
negatively impact the user experience by understanding context, domain and users;
using both leads to more comprehensive and effective testing and heuristic
evaluations.
</p> 
<p>   Several tools can fit into the CI/CD pipeline to automate tests, such as Selenium
WebDriver performs performance and accessibility audits for web pages and
HTML components for usability. It can produce tests for various devices and
displays.

<p>   Axe by Deque Systems provides a set of JavaScript APIs and browser
extensions that allow developers to automate accessibility testing during the
development and testing phases. Axe integrates into various development
workflows, including manual testing, automated testing, and continuous
integration.

<p>Designers need to be made aware of what improvements are necessary to
accommodate the needs of the audience. Gaining feedback is essential for improving

individual’s needs to identify and understand each person’s specific learning
difficulties gaining insights into strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. Using
active listening promotes understanding with individuals. Ensuring communication is
empathetic validating feelings by using about your own experiences can ensure a
positive experience. Active listening hen a person is misinformed person can help
identify what fallacies the person holds and help the person be more receptive to
argument. To fosters clarity and prevents misunderstandings paraphrase what is said

<p>Organizations can have positive intentions to help; they need to ensure a person’s
agency and decision-making capabilities are respected, which may lead to people
losing their sense of autonomy, individual rights, and self-determination, pointing to
neurodiversity champions or executive sponsors for neurodiversity initiatives that can
